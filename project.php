it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you
 do not know where to start with. 
 I always wanted to be a great writer, like Victor Hugo  or like
  Roman Roland . They have influenced millions of people through 
  their books. I also wanted to be a great psychologist, like William James or Sigmund Freud, 
  who could read people mind. Of course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just someone
  who does some teaching, some research, and some writing. But my dream is still alive. ";
